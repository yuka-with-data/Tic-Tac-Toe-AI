# AI Project - Tic Tac Toe

This is a repository of my Python code for AI programming. I created it based on the Introduction to AI in Python course from Harvard Online. It contains my exercises and examples of AI applications in Python.

## Tic Tac Toe AI Agent
### Objective:
To develop an AI agent capable of playing the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human opponent. The project focuses on implementing an algorithm that allows the AI to make intelligent moves and provide a challenging gameplay experience. The AI should be able to analyze the current state of the game, determine the best possible move based on that state, and respond accordingly. The project aims to provide a practical example of implementing game-playing AI algorithms and exploring various strategies in the context of a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe.

### Goal:
The human player should never be able to beat the AI!!
